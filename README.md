CREATING CRUD OPERATIONS
THEME:
In this section, we will create a simple asp.net core (MVC) app with backend as sql server and frontend will contain a simple page for showing the categories and allowing user to update or delete it. A complete CRUD app with backend.

KEY POINTS:
1-We can change the name of the Models Folder but not the Views and Controller.
2-Press `props` -> tab to auto generate the property in a model on visual studio.
3-How can we explicitly define the primary key in our model?
To do this, we need to use data annotations
i-Write [Key] above the attribute you want to set as primary key in your model.
ii-But if the attribute name is Id Entity Framework Core will automatically assume this to be a primary key, so we don't need to explicitly tell which is our primary key.
iii-Also if we write the ModelnameId, EFC will still treat it as a primary key.
iv-It's best practice to explicitly write the [Key] so that in future we can easily understand that this attribute is a primary key.
4-[Required] if we use this with any attribute and create a table based on this model, then the sql generated for this model will have non-null attribute in the table.
5-When you are installing packages from the NuGet Package Manager, make sure to install all the packages of the same version like if youare installing Microsoft.EntityFramewokrCore of version 8.0.0 then install other packages of this version.
6-Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools, this packages will enable the commands used for migration.
7-Right click on the project and select `Edit Project File` to view and edit dependencies manually.
8-We define the sql server connection in the appsettings.json file by creating a new key with the name `ConnectionStrings`, it's recommended because
One of this attribute of the ConnectionStrings might be `DefaultConnection`, we connect with the sql server based on the following syntax:
"DefaultConnection": "Server=(server name here);Database=(Database name here);Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
We use above syntax when we don't have any authentication on our database but if we do have then we remove the Trusted_Connection=True
and provide two more attriubtes that is User ID and Password, like in the below syntax:
"DefaultConnection": "Server=10.170.192.52;Database=Medcare_DB_Dev;User ID=your_username;Password=your_password;TrustServerCertificate=True"
9-Basic Configuration of Entity Framework
We need to create a ApplicationDbContext class which needs to implement DbContext
10-Press ctor and hit enter to generate a constructor for the current class.
11-When we need to register anything, we do it in the Program.cs
12-When we need to create any table, we need to create a property of type DBSet in our ApplicationDbContext
13-When we need to create a table(entity), we use the command `add-migration` migrationname
and then a file would be created with the name timestamp_migrationname.cs. This file will contain a code generated by the Entity Framework
to create a table in the sql server.
14-`update-database`, it will check if there are new migrations are created and apply them on database
15-Run the commands like `add-migration` and `update-database` in the Package Manager Console.
16- create model -> add migration -> update-database
17-When we create a Controller say CategoryController, by default it will return Index()
and it will be searched at two locations first at the /Veiws/Category/Index.cshtml and second at the /Views/Shared/Index.cshtml(Partial Views)
and a default route would be the serverurl/category/Index where /Index is optional because by default it is /Index
18-In the latest dotnet core, if you enalbe the hot reload then you don't need to update the browser if you change the View but this does not apply to controller
